### Guidelines for ACCESSIBILITY

#### MOBILE_ACCESSIBILITY

- Ensure touch targets are at least 44 by 44 pixels for comfortable interaction on mobile devices
- Implement proper viewport configuration to support pinch-to-zoom and prevent scaling issues
- Design layouts that adapt to both portrait and landscape orientations without loss of content
- Support both touch and keyboard navigation for hybrid devices with {{input_methods}}
- Ensure interactive elements have sufficient spacing to prevent accidental activation
- Test with mobile screen readers like VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)
- Design forms that work efficiently with on-screen keyboards and autocomplete functionality
- Implement alternatives to complex gestures that require fine motor control
- Ensure content is accessible when device orientation is locked for users with fixed devices
- Provide alternatives to motion-based interactions for users with vestibular disorders
